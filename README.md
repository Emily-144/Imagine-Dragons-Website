# Imagine-Dragons-Website &#127925;  

### Another school project from 2020! This one also includes HTML and CSS, but with a few added features.  

**Assignment:**  
Create a website that promotes a band. Include media, lists, and either radio buttons or checkboxes (collecting user data is unnecessary for this project).

I decided to take a more creative approach to this website by changing the background and adding some more decoration with CSS and a link to the band's Spotify page. As the project required user interaction through radio buttons or checkboxes (but not data collection), I also decided to make a separate page for a Music Survey, where the company could see what type of music the user likes, and also view one of the band's music videos. *(Note: The instructor preferred that CSS was included in the HTML files rather than a separate file)*

**Languages/Resources Used:**  
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Visual Studio
